VPS Masternode Setup Guide



Introduction



This guide is for a single masternode, on a Ubuntu 16.04 64bit server (VPS) running headless and will be controlled from the wallet on your local computer (Control wallet). The wallet on the the VPS will be referred to as the Remote wallet.



You will need your server details for progressing through this guide.



First the basic requirements:



1. Starx MN Collateral

2. A main computer (Your everyday computer) – This will run the control wallet, hold your MN Collateral and can be turned on and off without affecting the masternode.

3. Masternode Server (VPS – The computer that will be on 24/7)

4. A unique IP address for your VPS / Remote wallet



(For security reasons, you’re are going to need a different IP for each masternode you plan to host)



The basic reasoning for these requirements is that, you get to keep your Starx in your local wallet and host your masternode remotely, securely.







Local Wallet Configuration



1. Using the control wallet, enter the debug console (Tools >help - Debug console) and type the following command: masternode genkey (This will be the masternode’s privkey. We’ll use this later…)



2. Using the control wallet still, enter the following command: getaccountaddress ChooseAnyNameForYourNewAddress



3. Still in the control wallet, send MN Collateral to the address you generated in step 2 (Be 100% sure that you entered the address correctly. You can verify this when you paste the address into the “Pay To:” field, the label will autopopulate with the name you chose”, also make sure this is exactly MN Collateral. No less, no more.) – Be absolutely 100% sure that this is copied correctly. And then check it again. We cannot help you, if you send MN Collateral to an incorrect address.



4. Still in the control wallet, enter the command into the console: masternode outputs (This gets the proof of transaction of sending MN Collateral)



5. go to masternode tab and fill in the needed details: alias (this is the name of address you choose in step 2) address (vps iP) txhash (result from step 4) ouput index (this is the second result generated in step 4, its mostly 0 or 1)  txhash: cc5220e580d14409ddcdb6ee6457c476cd58436a5ebf74f9038325a1793b90da): output index: 0) privkey: Result generated from stp 













VPS Remote wallet install



1. Log in to your VPS console as root or sudo user and copy paste lines:



cd ~ && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install unzip nano libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev software-properties-common -y



sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin -y

sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev




sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libdb5.3-dev libdb5.3++-dev libminiupnpc-dev libevent-2.0-5 libevent-pthreads-2.0-5 libevent-dev -y && wget https://github.com/ezehy/starcashx/raw/master/starsxubunew.zip && unzip starsxubunew.zip



./StarCashXd







Configuration Cont.



Now on the VPS, edit the eBux configuration file:



nano ~/.StarCashX/StarCashX.conf



Make the config look like this:



rpcuser=long random username

rpcpassword=longer random password

rpcallowip=127.0.0.1

server=1

daemon=1

logtimestamps=1

maxconnections=256

masternode=1

masternodeprivkey=Result of Step 1 from Local Wallet Configuration





Make sure to replace rpcuser and rpcpassword with your own.



to exit the editor press Ctrl+o, enter and Ctrl+x







Start your masternode



Now, you need to finally start these things in this order – Start the daemon client in the VPS. First go back to your installed wallet directory,



cd ~



and then start the wallet using



./StarCashXd





Now, restart Control wallet, go to Masternode tab, select masternode and press "Start"



The following should appear: “Alias: “ “Successfully started masternode”,







Congratulations! You have successfully created your masternode!
